# Questions: 

  * cash bond data source? Court watch project, anything else? looking at other states, looks like some research relied on court records
  * on view vs. summons vs. custody - what is on view and how does it fit into this? (no documentation)
  * low level offense categorizations from state categories? makes sense? 
  * jail - statewide? major cities? (less POC in other areas which affects the balance)
